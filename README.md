## Overview

### Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned:

I used this project to focus on how to use Flexbox to center the card both horizontally and vertically. I created one overall DIV container and set to a display of Flex. I then used flexbox on inside the content too so that the items are aligned and evenly spaced.

I found this trickier than I thought I would and not sure if I would have been better off using a Grid set-up instead. Still, it worked and that's the main thing!

#### What am I most proud of?
- Completed my first project on Frontend Mentor!
- Getting this to be somewhat responsive (although I am sure this could be worked on further!)

### Continued development:

I definitely still need to work on layouts using Flexbox and Grids. I am finding these quite tricky to get my head around!
